## About this project

------

An portfolio built by me for me. The gulp js config and file structure was forked from another opensource project. Vue js has been used for DOM manipulation and project scalablity. Gulp js has been used to automate tasks and to enhance workflow. This is an Opensource project, hence anyone else can use the template.

The UI/UX was conceived with a **"mobile first"** approach. So the website can be viewed on any screen size with ease.
