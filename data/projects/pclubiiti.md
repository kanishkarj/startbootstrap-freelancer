## About this project

------

This is an OpenSource project under the Programming Club of Indian Institute of Technology Indore. The template was forked from another opensource project. Vue js has been used for DOM manipulation and project scalablity. Gulp js has been used to automate tasks and to enhance workflow.

The UI/UX was conceived with a **"mobile first"** approach. So the website can be viewed on any screen size with ease.
